File manager
============
A **file manager**, also called **file browser**, is a software or app, which provides functionalities to manager directories and folders on a file system. These functions mostly, but not always and not exclusively, include to delete, copy, move create or modify a file.

Features
--------

### View of files and folders
The basic feature of a file manager is the ability to show directories and the content of these directories, which mostly can be some more directories and/or files, as well as navigating through the structure of these directories. The functionalities differs between the different available file managers. E.g. some managers are able to view hidden files (like shown in the right image, hidden folders are transparent), others managers may show the file structure more intuitively.

### File transfer

Graphical file managers may support copying and moving of files through "copy and paste" and "cut and paste" respectively, as well as through "drag and drop", and a separate menu for selecting the target path.

While transferring files, a file manager may show the source and destination directories, transfer progress in percentage and/or size, progress bar, name of the file currently being transferred, remaining and/or total number of files, numerical transfer rate, and graphical transfer rate. The ability to pause the file transfer allows temporarily granting other software full sequential read access while allowing to resume later without having to restart the file transfer.

### User interface

Some file managers contain features analogous to web browsers, including forward and back navigational buttons, an address bar, tabs, and a bookmark sidebar.

### Networking

Some file managers provide network connectivity via protocols, such as FTP "File transfer protocol", HTTP "Hypertext Transfer Protocol", NFS "Network File System (protocol)", SMB "Server Message Block" or WebDAV "WebDAV". This is achieved by allowing the user to browse for a file server connecting and accessing the server's file system like a local file system or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols.
